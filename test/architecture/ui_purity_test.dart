/// Purity rule for `lib/ui/`. Screens may use Dart, Flutter, bloc &
/// friends, the domain layer, sibling files within their own screen,
/// and a small set of shared UI subfolders.
///
/// Cross-screen imports (`ui/home/` ↔ `ui/auth/`) are forbidden — screens
/// are composed in `app/navigation/`. The shared subfolders listed in
/// [sharedSiblings] (`common/`, `design_system/`, `navigation/`) are
/// exempt from sibling isolation: any screen may import them, and they
/// themselves don't count as "siblings" when imported.
///
/// We chose option (b) from the brief: enable [isolateSiblingSubdirs]
/// AND mark the legitimate shared folders, instead of disabling
/// isolation entirely. This preserves the architectural intent while
/// matching the template's actual layout.
///
/// Extend [allowedExternalPackages] when introducing a new UI-facing
/// dependency (e.g. an animation package). Avoid leaking transport or
/// storage packages here — those belong to `data/`.
